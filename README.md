# Blackjack

This project is based on the classic card game Blackjack. The user (player) plays against the dealer to get as close as possible to 21 without going over. 

Card values are face value for 2-10. For face cards (King, Queen, Jack), the value is 10 and for Aces, the value is either 1 or 11.

The player starts with 1000 "money" and choose a betting amount. The player is dealt cards and can hit (take a card) or stand (stop taking cards). The dealer hits on 16 or less and stands if 17 or more.

To win, the player's total must be higher than the dealer's total without busting (being over 21) or if the dealer busts.
